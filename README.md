## Problem Statement
The past few years have seen a rise in the invention of different social media platforms, from Facebook to Twitter and others like Instagram. They have given people a platform to share their thoughts, opinion and to even express their frustrations about their lives. Reviews on products and services are mostly done on social media platforms like Twitter, which has a way of reaching a larger audience in a short amount of time. Over the years, Twitter has been instrumental in changing policies in many cooperations as the feedback on services and products posted on the platform has been seen to affect the decision made by many consumers.

The project is aimed at understanding the problems of major US airlines by doing sentiment analysis on tweets posted about said airlines. The focus will be on negative tweets. Our goal as Data Scientists is to create a model that classifies the negative tweets into a certain class of reason. This is aimed at improving customer satisfaction by improving services.

## Definition of Metric of Success
The project will be a success when we:

Create a model that will classify the negative tweets into the different classes of reasons. I.e Late Flight, Rude Sevice etc

The model should have an accuracy of atleast 80%.

##Understanding the Context
The factors for negative online airline reviews are:

* Bad services

* Rude Staff

* Delayed flights

* Cancelled flights

* Lost Luggage

* Poor communication especially regarding cancelled/ Delayed flights

* Faulty seats

* Dirty and smelly planes.

## Experimental Design
The experimental design is as follows:

* Exploratory Data Analysis

* Data Cleaning

* Univariate Analysis

* Bivariate Analysis

* Multivariate Analysis

* Modelling:Recurrent Neural networks, TensorFlow

#Data Relevance
The relavance of our data will be answered by the following questions.

* How accurate is the data?

* Was the dataset sufficient?

* Was the data biased?

* Is the data source a reliable source?
